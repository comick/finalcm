Simple, buggy composite manager for the X Window System.
It's written in C and use the xcb X C bindings.
I did it for an interface design exam during University in circa 2010.

It's fairly incomplete and only run using blackbox window manager.
I wanted to learn some X11 server interaction.

Contains expose-like effect for placing windows, ceverswitch-like effect to choose between windows and other glue stuff.
Also, track changes to widnow and draw real-time (eg. scaled in the coverswitch or expose).

Install xcb libraries and headers for damage, xfixes, xrender, composite, atom, then make, then:

./finalcm

during a blackbox session with some window already opened.

Upper-left corner cursor triggers the expose-like effect, alt+tab does the coverswitch effect.
Super+{+/-} zooms in and out the interface (it's buggy and unoptimized).

It's pretty simple code, hope being a good resource for simple xcb examples.
